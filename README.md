## 🧑‍🎓 About Me  
Hey there! I’m Marnie, a 24-year-old with a passion for turning messy data into meaningful stories. I’m currently diving headfirst into the world of data analytics through just completing a **Skills Bootcamp in Data Fundamentals**, where I learnt to wrangle data, code like a pro, and create stunning visualizations.  

### 📚 **The Academic Stuff**  
- 🎓 **BA (Hons) Criminology** (2:1) – I love understanding the “why” behind human behavior.  
- 🎓 **M.Sc. in Psychology** (Merit) – Because one degree wasn’t enough!  

### 🎿 **The Fun Stuff**  
- I’m an **avid skier** who’s happiest on the slopes with snowflakes in my hair (and a helmet of course!).
- ✈️ **Travel Lover**: I’ve visited **24 countries** so far and spent **6 months backpacking around Southeast Asia** – from stunning beaches to bustling cities, it was the adventure of a lifetime!
- Took a **Code First Girls MOOC** on **Intro to Python**, and I’m hooked on coding!  
- Currently planning my next learning adventure – probably another MOOC or certification. 🚀
